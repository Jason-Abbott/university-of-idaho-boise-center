Overview
<p>
<font size=5>D</font>istrict II encompasses the ten counties of southwestern Idaho, a region that stretches from the Nevada Border north to the Little Salmon River.  Agricultural enterprises include farming, ranching, and dairying.  Tree fruit, seed, row crops and forages are the main crops that span the Boise, Payette, and Weiser River valleys.  Cow-calf operations center in the rangeland areas of Owyhee, Washington, and Adams counties.  Dairies are located in Ada and Canyon counties.  Extension education covers production, management, and marketing of these agricultural commodities, as well as natural resource conservation and development.  
<p>
Rapid business and industrial expansion in Boise has encouraged population growth that spills over into the surrounding counties.  Agricultural lands are rapidly being turned into housing developments.  Schools are crowded and communities are constrained in providing adequate public services.  Tourism and recreation enterprises are expanding in the mountain areas; McCall and New Meadows are becoming resorts.  Extension educational programs for communities include public policy education, multiple-use of lands, conflict resolution, decision-making, and problem-solving.  
<p>
Extension education for families and youth include family financial management, food safety and preservation, nutrition, diet, and health, as well as family and youth development.  Leadership and volunteer development programs include the 4-H Program, Master Gardeners, Master Food Preservers, and Master Clothing Teachers.  Federal grants fund educational programs in water quality as well as nutrition and resource management for low income families.
