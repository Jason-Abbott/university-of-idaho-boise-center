Valley County's 3,670 square miles lie in the  mountainous heartland of Idaho about 60 miles north of Boise.  With the exception of a few towns in large intermontane valleys, most of the land in the county is publicly owned and sparsely populated.  This land offers a multitude of recreational opportunities.
