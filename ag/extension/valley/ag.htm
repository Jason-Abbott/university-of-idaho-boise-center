While Valley County does not have an Agriculture Extension Educator, the office can contact other Extension Educators and specialists to answer your agriculture questions.
<P>Agriculture has been a basic part of Valley County's economy since the first settlers arrived.  Agriculture is diversified.  The top five Agriculture products in Valley County are cattle, pasture rentals, potatoes, wheat, barley and hay.  Of these, cattle bring in 82 percent of the farm income in the county.</P>
<P>The total acres in farms have decreased dramatically over the past 30 years, but especially in the last decade.  In part this is due to increasing numbers of housing developments with large lot acreages.  Expansion of existing farms has almost completely ceased because of the high price of land.</P>
