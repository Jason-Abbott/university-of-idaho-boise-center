<CENTER><H1>Natural Resources of Valley County</H1></CENTER>
Valley County's 3,670 square miles lie in the mountainous heartland of Idaho.  Most of the land in the county is publicly owned and sparsely populated.  This land offers a wide variety of uses, from recreation to timber and range resource development. Land management often brings conflicts, but these are an integral part of managing the land as well as possible.

<H4>Wildlife</H4><EM></EM>
Wildlife is representative of that for northwest mountains.  Elk, deer, mountain lion and other large animals attract hunters.  Smaller animals attract observers.  Wolves have been reintroduced.

Raptors, many of which overwinter in the canyon lands of the Snake and Salmon River, return to nest in the summer.  The abundance of habitats and water attract numerous other species of birds.

Trout, salmon, greyling and perch are prevalent species of sport fish.  The Salmon River drainage is an important spawning habitat for steelhead trout and Endangered species of ocean-going salmon.

<H4>Mineral/Rock Resources</H4><EM></EM>

Despite a historic gold rush, only a few profitable ore bodies exist and are being mined in Valley County.  A few commercial deposits of gravel are also being mined.

<H4>Water Resources</H4><EM></EM>

1.7% of the total acreage of Valley County is in water.  This acreage includes portions of the North Fork Payette River, South and Middle Forks of the Salmon River, and several small and large lakes.  

Water resources are extremely important to the health and economy of the county.  All the water bodies attract numerous recreationist, including fishermen, whitewater enthusiasts and boaters.  The reservoirs provide irrigation water in Valley County and counties to the south.  Much of the county's scenic beauty is because of water; and most communities are close to or edging lakes and rivers.
Water Quality

Water quality, while quite good in general, has been adversely affected by logging, pasturing and other land uses.  Water quality remains in the forefront of public land issues in Valley County.
