Direct your horticulture questions to us!  The Master Gardening Program is very strong in Valley County, and we have Master Gardeners who specialize in anything from cold-climate gardening to composting.  They will help you grow a productive and beautiful garden.

<P>
If you are interested in signing up to become a Master Gardener, contact the Extension Office.  The next series of classes will be held in the winter of 1999.
