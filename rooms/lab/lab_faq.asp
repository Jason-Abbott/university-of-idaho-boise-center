Boise Center lab FAQ
<!--#include virtual="/header_end.inc"-->


<ol>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How do I login?</font></b><br>
At present, there is only one login for the lab.  The username is <i>student</i> and there is no password (make sure it is blank).
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>Can I login into my Moscow account?</font></b><br>
If you are accustomed to using the labs on the Moscow campus you will be used to entering a personal username and password to gain access to your e-mail and files.  This is not possible in the Boise Center.  The Boise Center computers are not able to see the Moscow servers.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How do I check my e-mail?</font></b><br>
You must use telnet to check your e-mail.  For University of Idaho students and employees, this means you must have a nest account that you can access using Pine or Elm.  This also means that you must know what your e-mail password is, which may be different from your Novell password.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How can I use the sideways CDROM drives?</font></b><br>
The CDROM drives that are installed in the computers on edge have clips on the tray to hold your CD in the proper position.  If you're having trouble with your CD confirm that these clips are twisted into place.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How do I scan a picture?</font></b><br>
There is only one computer in the lab that can be used for scanning.  It is in the back right, as seen on the <a href="lab_intro.asp">previous page</a>.  First place your picture in the scanner.  Then select Start, Programs, Visual and Deskscan.  This will launch the scanning software.  At the bottom of the program will be a "Preview" button.  Press this to get a preview of your picture.  Adjust color and size as needed then press "Final" at the bottom and select a location to save your scanned image.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How do I scan text?</font></b><br>
Use OmniPage Pro 8.0 in the "Visual" folder of "Programs" in the Start menu.  It has wizards to guide you through the process.  Note that this software is available only at the scanning computer.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>Why isn't there a ZIP drive with the scanner?</font></b><br>
While it would make sense to have a ZIP drive in the same computer that has the scanner, the devices (at least the versions that we have) conflict and so cannot both operate in one computer.  If you would like to get your scanned images onto a ZIP disk simply save the files to the T: drive while scanning and then move to another computer that has a ZIP drive and pull them from the T: drive to your ZIP disk.
<p>
<li><font face="arial"><b>How can I make the monitor on the instructor's computer display a higher resolution?</font></b><br>
The instructor's computer is limited to a resolution of 640x480 because that's the maximum resolution supported by the attached LCD projector.  It's more important that this projector work than that we run in a high resolution, so the resolution cannot be increased.
