	TechHelp&#153; is a non-profit organization sponsored by the Idaho Manufacturing Alliance &#151; existing business networks and resources dedicated to cooperation in sharing "know-how" that helps Idaho's producing firms modernize. Affiliation with similar organizations in other states makes additional help and resources available.  TechHelp&#153; is a collaborative effort between Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho.</font></td>

	Implementing a restoration philosophy that places an emphasis on allowing the physical processes to drive the ecological healing by natural evolution, rather than an instantaneous engineering fix, developing management plans, simulating the hydrological or ecological responses and untangling the complexities of aquatic systems require an interdisciplinary approach, which crosses the boundaries of science and engineering programs. In 1996, the International Association for Hydraulic Research identified the need to create a forum where biologists, hydrologists, geomorphologists, micro-biologists, water chemists, toxicologists, statisticians, modelers and hydraulic engineers could exchange ideas and information and created a new section called "Eco-hydraulics".</font></td>

	<font size=2>
	The MRC Institute was one of six original Centers of Excellence established at the University of Idaho in 1983 with the mission to expand the capabilities of electronic technology by specializing in the design of high performance integrated circuits. The mission of the MRC Institute was to meet the need of regional industry, government, and scholarship through the application, manufacture, development, design, and verification of high performance microelectronics circuit and systems. On August 1, 1995, Dr. Touraj Assefi became the Director of the MRC Institute. Under his direction, the MRC Institute's role was expanded to include other disciplines such as avionics, simulation, multi-media, and real-time graphics technologies.</font></td>

	The Idaho Quality Schools Consortium was founded in 1997 as one of several initiatives associated with the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation designed to positively impact Idaho's public schools. The Consortium's mission is to provide Idaho schools with the training and support needed to implement Quality Management theory and processes as a means of ensuring a high quality education for every student. The Consortium thus helps schools and school districts create and manage effective change that results in the continuous improvement of student learning.</font></td>
