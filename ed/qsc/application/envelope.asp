The Quality Schools Consortium  ~  Common Characteristics of Leaders
<font></td></table>

Leaders are well described in the following paragraphs. As a group, leaders:
<P>
<B>1. hold dear a core set of values;</B>
<ul>
Leaders have established in their lives, often early on,  a core set of values that governs their behavior. These values further provide them with a sense of integrity, often translated by others into individual trust.</ul><P>

<B>2. possess a compelling vision of a preferred future;</B>
<p><ul>
Leaders translate their core values into a compelling vision of the future, for both themselves and for those they lead. While they are well grounded in the past and can accurately perceive today's reality, creating the future is their special calling.</ul><p>

<B>3. are deeply motivated by cause;</B>
<p><ul>

Leaders are neither hired nor appointed, but are rather called forth to serve a cause which they identify as particularly meaningful to them. They are compelled to serve this cause and often passionate in its pursuit. They are not motivated by personal gain. There is no such thing as a selfish leader.</ul><p>

<B>4. believe that reality is malleable;</B><ul><p>

Leaders believe that reality is largely determined by the lens through which we view it, and that this view is subject to change. Reality is thus malleable, not fixed. They further believe that the locus of control resides within the self and/or the organization. They thus believe that they can invent the future.</ul><p>

<B>5. are energetically proactive;</B><ul><p>

Leaders thrive on making things happen.  Their commitment to cause gives them high energy and dedicated focus. Their future orientation further leads them to be more proactive than reactive.</ul><p>


<B>6. possess a deep love of learning;</B><ul><p>

Leaders are constant learners. They are curious and inquisitive, and always on the alert for new ideas. They feel compelled to expand their knowledge and understanding and to translate new ideas into action.
<p></ul>
<B>7. readily use both sides of the brain;</B>
<p><ul>
Leaders use the right side of the brain for visioning, intuiting, synthesizing, conceptualizing‹and then the left side for analyzing, organizing, detailing, sequencing. In short, they are able to use both sides of the brain and frequently do so in an integrated manner.</ul><p>

<B>8. are collaborative and synergistic;</B><ul><p>

Leaders thrive on group collaboration, on improving ideas through shared creativity, on honoring diversity. They subscribe to an abundance mentality, to win-win solutions, to the notion that the whole is definitely more than the sum of its parts.<p></ul>

<B>9. embrace risk of their own making;</B><ul><p>

Leaders thrive on risk, but risk of their own making. They are not at risk, i.e., reacting to something that is happening to them, but rather in risk which they created. Leading is not repeating, copying, replicating, but rather creating something new and assuming the risks that this entails.</ul><p>

<B>10. are passionately committed.</B><ul><p>

Leaders are passionate about their work and seek constantly to close the gap between reality and their vision of the future. They are rarely satisfied with the results they achieve, no matter how positive they may be, and continuously pursue improvement in everything they do.</ul><p>


<I>"Tomorrow's leaders will probably include you
if you have a mind that relishes complexity, a heart that is passionately value-driven, a soul that is destined to be keeper of the vision, and a fire that will never die! The passion and confidence of tomorrow's leaders will move us beyond what is and what has been into visions of what can be, what could be, and what has not yet been imagined."  ~  <B>Jerry Patterson</B></I>
<P>
All organizations need both leaders and managers, and sometimes attempt to combine these important responsibilities in the same position. The case is frequently made, however, that the personal characteristics of leaders and managers are very different. <a href="../activities/leader.asp">The following brief comparison will enable you to consider which of these two might more accurately describe you.</a>
