Step Two:  A Request for Sharing Your Perceptions
<font></td></table>
	
A professional colleague of yours has decided to apply for membership in 
the Idaho Quality Leadership Institute sponsored by the Quality Schools 
Consortium. As part of the application process, the candidate is asked to 
gather the perceptions of three professional colleagues regarding the 
degree of congruence between the applicant and a descriptive list of 
characteristics of leaders. Please study this attached list and complete 
a one to two page statement that addresses the following:

<ol>
<li>name of applicant; your name; the nature of your professional 
relationship with the applicant; how long you have known the applicant.
<li>the three characteristics of leaders which you feel most clearly 
describe the applicant; cite examples of associated behavior if possible;
<li>the two characteristics of leaders which you believe the candidate 
exemplifies the least and, if possible, a brief explanation of your 
observations.
<li>a statement of how you believe children would benefit from the 
applicant's participation in an intensive learning experience that 
emphasizes leadership, change, and Quality Management.
<li>any other statement you would like to make regarding the applicant.
<li>information on how you can be contacted by phone and/or e-mail for any 
follow-up information regarding the applicant.
</ol>

You are asked to provide this information in writing in whatever format 
is most convenient for you. Please note that your responses will be 
immediately available to the applicant.  If you have any questions 
regarding this matter or the Quality Leadership Institute, call Julie or 
Anne at the Quality Schools Consortium, 208-364-4017, or e-mail 
<a href="mailto:jsolberg@uidaho.edu">jsolberg@uidaho.edu</a>.
