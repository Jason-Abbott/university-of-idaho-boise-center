	<td><font face="arial" size="2">"Most of the outstanding leaders I have worked with are neither tall nor especially handsome; they are often mediocre public speakers; they do not stand out in a crowd; and they do not mesmerize an attending audience with their brilliance or eloquence. Rather, what distinguishes them is the clarity and persuasiveness of their ideas, the depth of their commitment, and their openness to continually learning more."<br><B>Peter&nbsp;Senge</B></font>

<B>Introduction:  </B></font>

The application process for the Quality Leadership Institute is designed to
be a learning experience. If you want to learn more about the
characteristics of leaders, whether such characteristics are particularly
descriptive of you, and how your colleagues perceive you relative to these
characteristics, you can complete the full application process.
<P>
Of course you can also go the Leadership-Lite route - simply read the
material contained in the application. But we think you'll want at least to
see how your personal characteristics and attributes compare with those of
leaders, so don't read too far before getting out your pencil!

<P>
The Quality Schools Consortium (QSC) intends to identify, develop, inspire and support a cadre of Idaho educators who wish to lead their schools and school districts to higher levels of student learning.  We intend to do so by offering unique learning opportunities and support mechanisms to this group that address such topics as personal and organizational change, leadership, and Quality Management.  This document provides the first of such learning opportunities in the form of an application for membership in the Quality Leadership Institute (QLI).
<P>


The QSC has designed the Quality Leadership Institute around five premises. QSC believes that:<P><ul>
<B>1.</B> Leaders produce change through shared values and vision. Creative change is a leader's primary function, purpose and passion.
<p>
<B>2.</B> Leaders are neither born nor trained. Individuals learn to lead, to a considerable extent through their own life experiences.
<p>
<B>3.</B> Leaders can be neither assigned nor appointed. There is no relationship between leading and positions of authority. 
<p>
<B>4.</B> A leader does not act alone, but rather leads someone else, at a given time and  place.
<p>
<B>5.</B> Managing is a science, leading is a relationship.
The conceptual basis of the QLI and our approach to providing learning opportunities for participants stem from the works of such authors as Joel Barker, Warren Bennis, Bill Cooke, Stephen Covey, Peter Drucker, Joseph Jaworski, John Kotter, Tom Peters, Peter Senge, and Margaret Wheatley. Also included is the professional literature on Quality Management.

The QLI application process involves four steps:
<ol>
<li>completing a <a href="test1.asp">self-assessment</a> to help you decide if you should apply for membership in the QLI.

<li>securing <a href="test2.asp">written statements</a> from three professional colleagues comparing your personal characteristics and behaviors with those typical of leaders.

<li>preparing <a href="test3.asp">your own statement</a> of self-perceived strengths and weaknesses with respect to the leadership profile and responding to related questions.

<li>attaching a written statement from the appropriate individual in your learning organization indicating that, if selected as a member of the QLI, you will be granted up to five days of leave during the 1998-99 school year to participate in QLI learning activities. If securing such approval is not feasible in your school system by the application deadline, please include a statement from your immediate supervisor or other appropriate administrator that your later request for such leave will be supported by that individual.
</ul>

All application materials should be mailed in a single packet to:
