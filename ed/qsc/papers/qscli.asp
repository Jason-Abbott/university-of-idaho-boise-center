The Quality Leadership Institute
<font></td></table>

In a rapidly changing environment, the need within organizations for leaders greatly expands.  The Quality Schools Consortium is addressing this need through its Quality Leadership Institute.  The Institutes purpose is to identify, develop, inspire, and support such leaders as they go about their task of serving others in pursuit of a shared vision.   

<P>

<b>
1.  Introduction
<p></b>

It is the mission of the Quality Schools Consortium to provide Idaho schools
with the knowledge, training and support needed to implement Quality
Management theory and processes as a means to ensure a high quality
education for every student. The Consortium is a catalyst for change that
results in continuous improvement in student learning. We are thus clearly
in the business of identifying, growing and supporting leaders, for it is
leaders who produce change.
<P>
The major grant that funds the QSC recognizes the critical role that must be
played by leaders in bringing about continuous improvement in Idaho's
schools. The grant includes references to leadership training and to a
Quality Leadership Team. A one day leadership awareness seminar launched the
1997-98 QSC training effort. It is also to be noted that Quality Management
itself identifies leadership as essential to planning and implementing
continuous improvement efforts.
<P>
In light of the above, the Quality Schools Consortium intends to call forth,
train, inspire and support a cadre of leaders from within Idaho schools.
Because the QSC will be providing a significant amount of training on
Quality, leadership and change to our team of Trainer/Coach/Consultants,
much of this same training can be offered to members of the Quality
Leadership Institute at limited additional training expense. The cost to
individual participants or their sponsoring school districts can also be
extremely reasonable a year of quality learning experiences, collegial
networking and Consortium support for about the same cost of a single three
day seminar. This leadership development effort will also allow the QSC to
test a second model for catalyzing positive change in Idaho schools.
Finally, we believe that the direct participation of school district
personnel, QSC Trainer/Coaches, and university education faculty and
administrators in actual training, related seminars, and audioconferencing
activities will have a synergistic effect in improving Idaho education.
<P>
<B>2. Purpose</B> <P>
The purpose of the Quality Leadership Institute is five-fold:</I>
<p><ul>
<B>a.</B> to recognize educators who are potential or actual leaders in Idaho
schools and school districts and to provide them with the knowledge, skills,
and support needed to produce systemic change that leads to increased
student learning;<p>
<B>b.</B> to increase the practice of Quality principles in Idaho schools and
school districts, including college and university schools of education;<p>
<B>c.</B> to develop a growing network of educational leaders in an expanding
number of schools, school districts, colleges and universities who can
support one another in their critical endeavors;<p>
<B>d.</B> to recruit new schools and school districts to the Consortium;<p>
<B>e.</B> to gain maximum benefit from consortium resources.<p></ul>

<B>3. Activities</B><P>
The QSC, in the form of its Quality Leadership Institute, will:
<p><ul>
<B>a.</B> provide 20 selected educators from school districts and 6 from Idaho
colleges and universities with ten days of training on leadership, change
and Quality Management during the 1998-99 school year;<P>
<B>b.</B> conduct five half-day seminars, preceding or following  regular training
sessions, that help participants apply what they are learning to their
professional lives and settings;<P>
<B>c.</B> provide on-going support through bi-weekly audioconferences with QSC
trainer/coaches;<P>
<B>d.</B> encourage collegial networking and support through a Quality Leadership
Institute section on the QSC Website;<P>
<B>e.</B> offer the opportunity to earn graduate level university credit and a
Quality Leadership certificate upon completion of training and application
exercises.<P></ul>

<B>4. Selection Process</B>  
<p>The QSC will prepare and disseminate across the state a package of
information describing the QLI and the qualities and characteristics we seek
in candidates for training. These qualities and characteristics will be
based on the professional literature on leadership and change.
Candidates will apply for available positions and, as part of the
application process, will be required to secure from their school districts,
colleges or universities advance permission to take leave for up to five
days of professional training during the 1998-99 school year. The type of
leave will be determined by the school involved.
The QSC will select Institute members based upon established selection
criteria and will make all decisions in this regard at its discretion.
Preference will be given to one candidate from each of twelve Consortium
member school districts. College and university faculty members or
administrators will be nominated by their respective Deans.
</ul><p>
<B>5. Program Cost</B><P>  
The Quality Schools Consortium will provide:
<P><ul>
<B>a.</B> all formal training and training materials;<P>
<B>b.</B> the planning and facilitation of Institute seminars;<P>
<B>c.</B> all costs associated with audioconferencing activities;<P>
<B>d.</B> all program management costs.<P>
</ul>
Institute Participants and/or their sponsoring school districts will
provide:
