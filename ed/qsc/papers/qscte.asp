QSC Training Efforts  ~  A Position Paper
<font></td></table>

<B>A.  Introduction</B>
<P>
The Quality Schools Consortium exists to provide Idaho schools and school districts with the knowledge, training and support needed to implement Quality Management theory and processes in order to provide a high quality education for every student.  The Consortium’s purpose is thus to help schools and school districts create effective change that results in the continuous improvement of both schools and, most importantly, student learning.
<P>
Change requires the acquisition of new knowledge and skills and the adoption of new beliefs.  Training thus becomes a critical element in the services provided by the Quality Schools Consortium.  This document provides the conceptual framework for our training endeavors.  It reflects the lessons learned from our first year of training activity and the recommendations of Consortium members and of the QSC Steering Committee.  It includes a set of principles that will guide our training efforts, the general directions these efforts will take, and specific activities that will allow the QSC to meet it’s training goals.
<P>
<B>B.  Guiding Principles<P></B>
<P>
The following set of principles emerged from our collective experience during the 1997-98 school year and will guide our training efforts for the coming year.
<P>
The QSC’s training will:
<P><ul>
<B>1.</B>  recognize always that the purpose of school change is the continuous improvement of children’s learning;<p>
<B>2. </B> help educators create new visions of schools and the teaching/learning process and inspire new beliefs that can help make such visions reality;<p>
<B>3.</B>  recognize the critical role that strategic planning and the research on effective schooling play in creating positive school change.<p>
<B>4.</B>  be based on sound teaching/learning principles and practices;<p>
<B>5.</B>  address the need of all members of a learning community to understand the change process and the role each member can play in producing continuous improvement;<p>
<B>6.</B>  be customized to meet the specific needs of individual schools and school districts;<p>
<B>7. </B> include application in school settings and the coaching and support needed for successful implementation;<p>
<B>8.</B>  be affordable and deliverable in a cost-effective manner.<P></ul>

We believe these guiding principles will help the QSC provide training which will be viewed by Consortium members as having high value; which will continuously develop education related capacity and leadership among Idaho educators, citizens and the school community; and which will result in the continuous improvement of Idaho’s schools.
<P>
<B>C.  New Directions</B>
<P>
With these guiding principles in mind, the QSC will now;
<P><ul>
<B>1.</B>  define the school, as well as the school district, as a potential primary customer;<p>
<B>2.</B>  address the initial need for a targeted learning community (school or school district) to be prepared for change and to understand the elements of the change process;<p>
<B>3.</B>  include in the awareness stage of interacting with potential consortium members a guided assessment of District and/or school readiness for change;<p>
<B>4.</B>  provide opportunities for a school or school district to achieve consensus and commitment with regards to proceeding with a planned continuous improvement effort;<p>
<B>5.</B>  customize our training programs to meet the specific needs of individual schools and school districts;<p>
<B>6.</B>  adopt a project-based learning module that includes application, coaching, and consultation;<p>
<B>7.</B>  develop leadership and support capacity within the state, its geographical regions, and in individual school districts;<p>
<B>8.</B>  provide increased opportunity for networking among consortium members as a means of sharing successes and failures, gathering ideas, and gaining collegial support;<p>
<B>9. </B> encourage learning outside formal QSC training activities through information regarding resources on Quality Management
<P></ul>
<B>D.  Planned Activities
</B>
<P>
Based upon our guiding principles and new directions, which in turn have resulted from the best wisdom of our Consortium members and advisors, the Quality Schools Consortium will now proceed with the following activities;
<P><ul>
<B>1.</B>  While continuing to work with school districts, focus attention as well on the school and classroom as the basic units of change in education;<p>
<B>2.</B>  clearly define a series of learning experiences, coaching activities and consultation that will result in the successful application of Quality Management principles and practices in a school setting;<p>
<B>3.</B>  prepare a one year training and implementation plan for each participating school district and school that meets the specific needs of that organization;<p>
<B>4.</B>  create a small team of trainers/coaches who can deliver the prescribed training and support throughout the state and work closely with districts to ensure training success;<p>
<B>5.</B>  develop a set of training materials that will provide the learning experiences identified by the QSC as essential to the implementation of change and Quality Management and package these materials in a manner that will be of future benefit to schools throughout Idaho;<p>
<B>6.</B>  establish a Quality Leadership Institute that prepares selected Idaho educators to assume increasing responsibility within their schools and districts for creating positive change and continuous improvement in student learning.<p>
<B>7.</B>  create and maintain a QSC interactive Website that includes learning opportunities for a broad spectrum of Idaho educators, networking among Consortium members and information about resources available throughout the nation.<p>
