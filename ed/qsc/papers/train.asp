QSC Training Model
<font></td></table>

The Quality Schools Consortium divides its work with school districts into three stages: awareness, customized training/coaching; and implementation planning. Our working paper entitled QSC Training Efforts, available in hard copy or on the QSC website (www.uidaho.edu/ed/qsc), provides further background to our model. As a brief introduction, we intend that our training efforts:
<ul>
<li>will be delivered in response to group consensus regarding team or school participation;

<li>will focus on the continuous improvement of student learning;

<li>will enable participants to place continuous quality improvement into the broader educational context and ensure implementation success;

<li>will be customized to meet the specific needs of a given school or school district;

<li>will be based on sound principles of adult learning.
</ul>
The three stages of our training plan are described below.
<p>
<b>
I. Awareness</b><ul>

A. Exploration<p>

Based upon the information in such sources as the Quality Schools Consortium quarterly newsletter or the QSC Website, superintendents or delegated staff first contact the QSC Director to explore the Consortium at greater depth. The Director, in turn, reviews with the Superintendent the present position of the district with respect to such items as strategic planning, recent staff development efforts, board-administration and teacher association relations, and familiarity of staff with Quality principles and practices. A joint decision is then made whether or not to proceed further with the Awareness phase of the program.
<p>
B. Awareness for Administrative Staff or Leadership Team
<p>
A QSC Trainer/Coach/Consultant (TCC) next arranges with the district superintendent a time for an awareness workshop with a group that the superintendent identifies. This group might include the administrative staff, members of the school board, a district leadership team should one be in place, and/or others the superintendent wishes initially introduced to the QSC. During a three hour workshop, one or more TCCs will help the participants fully understand the Quality Schools Consortium program. 
<p>
Following the workshop, the superintendent and his/her staff will make a decision whether to proceed to the second part of the Awareness stage. If the decision is to proceed, they will also identify the appropriate participants in the second awareness workshop.
<p>
C. Awareness for Potential Participants
<p>
A Trainer/Coach/Consultant next provides an awareness workshop to the school or district staff who would be the direct participants in the continuous quality improvement effort were the district to join the QSC. In a small district, this group might consist of the entire staff; in a larger district, we anticipate that this group would be the staff of a particular school or schools. The TCC would also be available to make presentations to such groups as the district school board or an involved parent group.
<p>
D. Consensus
<p>
QSC requires that a decision to proceed following the second awareness workshop be based on a consensus of the staff involved. An agreement is then reached among the district's superintendent, school board and QSC Director, represented by formal Board action, for district membership in the Consortium.
</ul>
<b>
II. Customized Training
</b><p>
This stage is the heart of our training model. It includes intensive workshops, on-site coaching, and consultation. These staff development efforts will be customized to meet the specific needs of a given school or school district. For example, if a district has in place a well understood mission statement, a clear vision of where it is headed and a strategic plan to reach identified goals, QSC can help prepare staff for the achievement of such goals in a quality manner. However, if none of these elements exist, we will help you start at the very beginning.
<p>
We do anticipate that most schools and school districts will benefit from staff development activities in several of the following areas:
<ul>
<li>leading and managing change;
<li>visioning and strategic planning;
<li>systems thinking;
<li>team building and collaboration;
<li>continuous quality improvement: theory, process, and tools;
<li>quality in the classroom: theory, process and tools;
<li>creating a learning organization.</ul>
<p>
Our commitment is to provide learning experiences that will result in the continuous improvement of student learning. Depending upon individual school or district needs and time available for staff development activities, we anticipate that this stage will require from one to two years to complete.
</ul>
<b>
III. Implementation Planning and Support
<p></b>
While the training effort in phase II will be project-based, it is nevertheless only preparation for broader implementation. In phase III the QSC will assist member districts in developing a district-wide Quality Improvement Plan designed to implement Quality throughout the district. We will also assist the district in securing financial assistance for plan implementation and will continue to provide consultation as appropriate.
<p>
We believe that the Consortium member districts will continue to increase their capacity 
<ul>
<li>through the sharing of best practices, successes and failures with their colleagues through the QSC interactive website and quarterly newsletter; 

<li>through workshops, seminars and other resources of which they are made aware; and 

<li>through possible staff participation in the QSC Quality Leadership Institute.
</ul>
Finally, we anticipate that member schools and school districts will provide support and mentoring for other Idaho schools and school districts interested in implementing continuous process improvement.
