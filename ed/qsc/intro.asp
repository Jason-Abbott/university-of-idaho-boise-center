What is the Idaho Quality Schools Consortium?
<font></td></table>

The Idaho Quality Schools Consortium was founded in 1997 as one of several initiatives associated with the J.A. and Kathryn Albertson Foundation designed to positively impact Idaho's public schools.  The Consortium's mission is to provide Idaho schools with the training and support needed to implement Quality Management theory and processes as a means of ensuring a high quality education for every student.  The Consortium thus helps schools and school districts create and manage effective change that results in the continuous improvement of student learning.
<p>
The Consortium is affiliated with the University of Idaho.  Guided by a Steering Committe representing a cross section of Idaho's education community, a QSC Director plans and implements consortium strategies for project success.  Consortium members consist of a revolving group of school districts committed to creating continuous improvement in their schools.

What is meant by the term Quality Management?
<font></td></table>

Quality Management, as used by QSC, refers to the application to education systems of those principles and practices that have  revolutionized America's business world during the past twenty-five years.  An increasing number of schools are using Quality Management to change school climates and increase student learning.
<p>
The Quality Management approach involves an emphasis on customer satisfaction, a planned approach to change, systems thinking, leadership and learning, and collaboration and community.  Quality Management includes a set of beliefs and operating principles as well as specific tools helpful in identifying systemic problems and assessing improvement.
<p>
Schools throughout the United States are applying Quality Management practices in individual classrooms, entire schools and school districts.  Many business corporations are assisting in this effort.  Quality Management complements vision-driven strategic planning and the activities now required in new procedures for school accreditation.

How does the Quality Schools Consortium pursue its mission?
<font></td></table>

The QSC provides training, coaching and consultation in a three-stage process customized to the specific needs of each member district:
<dl>
<dt><b>Awareness and Consensus</b>
<dd>QSC personnel first visit with school and school district administrative staff or leadership teams to explain the QSC program in detail. If the district is then interested in pursuing a relationship with the QSC, we next provide a one-half or one-day introduction to Quality Management, change , and leadership to the school personnel who would be involved were the school district to join the Consortium.  We also welcome the opportunity to present such information to school boards and other community members.  A decision to proceed further is based upon some form of staff consensus.  While only school districts are actual Consortium members, the QSC can serve one or more schools within a member district.
<dt><b>Training and Coaching</b>
<dd>Working cooperatively with district personnel, the QSC staff plans a customized training program that will meet the needs of the involved educators and which contains critical elements necessary for success.  Training will include intensive workshops and on-site coaching and consultation.  The training cycle typically requires from one to two years to complete.
<dt><b>Planning and Support</b>
<dd>In the final state of the training process, the QSC assists the district in developing a multi-year plan for continuous improvement.  The QSC may also assist with issues related to future funding assistance from members of the Idaho business community.
<dt><b>Quality Leadership Institute</b>
<dd>In the interest of building in-state capacity for catalyzing educational change and continuous improvement, the QSC also operates a Quality Leadership Institute designed to identify, train, inspire and support a cadre of leaders in Idaho education.  The Institute focuses on individuals from both K-12 public schools and schools of education within Idaho's public colleges and universities.
