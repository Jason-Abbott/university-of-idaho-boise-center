What do Joseph Campbell, W. Edwards Deming, David Bohm, Joseph Jaworski and Margaret Wheatley have in common?  Their ideas about change and leadership were all part of the first session of the Idaho Quality Leadership Institute held in Boise on December 10 and 11, 1998.

Extensive reading, dialogue, experiential learning, individual and group reflection, and journaling are also key elements of the Institute.  Institute gatherings will be supplemented by audioconferences and member networking through the Leaders' Loft section of the Quality School Consortium's website.
