<font face="arial"><b>Solberg Assumes Reins of QSC</b></font>
<hr size="2" color="#2A7FAA">

In late January of this year, after the fledgling Quality Schools Consortium (QSC) had experienced four months of interim management by a private consulting firm, Julie Solberg became the consortium's Director.  "I was initially overwhelmed," admitted Julie in reflecting on her first four and a half months in the position, "but I knew that I'd ben given a wonderful opportunity to learn and to provide leadership to a cause I've always found worthy of my best effort - children's educations."
<P>
Prior to accepting the QSC directorship, Julie worked as a school psychologist for Joint School District 241 in Grangeville, her hometown.  Julie had also worked as a special education director and as a special education consultant with the Department of Education.  She is a past president of both the Idaho School Psychologists Association and the Idaho Network for Children.  Her last name is a familiar one to many older Idaho educators, for her late father, Nels L. Solberg, was a member of Idaho State Board of Education from 1979 to 1983, and was serving as its president at the time of his death.
<p>
"This spring we've been 'sharpening the saw' as an organization," stated Julie in a recent interview, referring to the 7th of Stephen Covey's habits.  "We have examined carefully our activities of the past school year, have smiled at what went well and have redesigned our delivery model based on the input we've received.  We intend to function as a significant player in Idaho education.  We invite schools and school districts to join us in bringing about continuous improvement in student learning."
<P>
Julie welcomes your interest in QSC.  You may contact her at the University of Idaho, Boise Center - phone 208-364-4017 or e-mail:  <a href="mailto:jsolberg@uidaho.edu">jsolberg@uidaho.edu</a>.

The Quality Schools Consortium is about change - and thus about learning, leadership, beliefs and systems thinking - and, yes, QSC is about Quality.
<P>
In October of 1997, the Albertson Foundation provided a grant to the University of Idaho to help school districts explore Quality Management approaches to producing continuous improvement in student learning.  Training for some districts began within two months, with an initial emphasis on Quality Management principles and practices.
<P>
In March of 1998, QSC Director Solberg made on site visits to eleven QSC member districts.  In April she consulted with the QSC Steering Committee.  The fruits of these labors is a redesigned training plan highlighted by the following:
<P>
<li>Individual schools will be the preferred focus for training within the context of district goals and improvement planning.
<P>
<li>QSC will help school and district staffs become informed about QSC program efforts and reach in-school and in-district consensus on joining QSC.
<P>
<li>Training will be customized to the needs of specific schools and districts with respect to both content and timing, and most training will be delivered on-site.
<P>
<li>Principles and practices of Quality Management will be viewed and applied within the broader scope of strategic planning, the teaching / learning process, leadership, and belief systems - in a manner that enables all participants to connect the dots and relate what they learn to their own professional and personal lives.
<P>
<li>Much of QSCs training will be project - based, with an emphasis on application in school settings.  Part of each trainers role will be to coach and consult in direct support of teaching and learning.
<P>
Implementing a customized training program will be a challenge, but this is what QSC customers say they need, and this is what Quality Management principles say QSC should deliver. In response, QSC is determined to meet the challenge.

	<b>QSC Launches Quality Leadership Institute</b></font></td>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#FFFFAA"><font size=2>
Throughout the 1998-1999 school year, twenty-five as yet unidentified Idaho educators will participate in a series of learning activities that will likely change their lives and hopefully also the lives of many of their students and colleagues.  To expand leadership capacity within Idaho education, and as a means of introducing Quality principles and practices into Idaho schools, the QSC will provide these educators a Quality Leadership Institute.  Institute participants will attend a series of workshops conducted by outstanding trainers and consultants.  Participants will also engage in several leadership seminars and bi-weekly collaborative networking.  We anticipate that twelve of the twenty-five available Institute openings will be filled by individuals from consortium member school districts, seven from other school districts throughout the state, and six by faculty or staff members from Idahos schools and colleges of education.
<P>
The Quality Schools Consortium is looking for individuals who are exemplary educators, good listeners and learners, and collaborative team builders who enjoy serving others and are dedicated to personal / professional and organizational growth.  In other words, we are seeking Idaho educations gems, a few pragmatic visionaries compelled to act.  If you know such an individual or if you are one - contact the Quality Schools Consortium for a more complete description of the Institute and its participant application process.

<font face="arial"><b>School Districts Receive Training in Quality</b></font>
<hr size="2" color="#2A7FAA">

During the 1997-98 school year, QSC introduced eleven Idaho districts to Quality Management.  Training included leadership, principles of Quality, tools for implementation of Quality, and the application of Quality Mangement in school settings.  Participant teams included faculty , administrators, board members, parents and, in some cases, students.  Educators from a few districts attended the National Summit on Quality in Education in Michigan. Over 220 individuals participated in this training.  The districts involved were Blaine County, Filer, Cambridge, Cascade, Fremont County, Glenns Ferry, Meridian, Moscow, Notus, Salmon and Twin Falls.
<P>
Meridian has now developed a plan for the implementation of Quality in their schools and secured their own Albertson grant for this purpose.  It is anticipated that other districts will follow this example.  QSC staff and the Steering Committee commend these school districts for being pioneers in the Quality in education movement in Idaho.

<font face="arial"><b>Creating Our Future</b></font><br>
<i>Reflections from the QSC Director</i>
<hr size="2" color="#2A7FAA">

The most critical factor in creating significant improvement in the performance of any organization is leadership.  I refer here not to mangement, authority or appointed position, but rather to the kind of individual behavior that can cause a group of people to collaboratively pursue a dream; i.e., to create their own future.  What is it that characterizes leaders able to achieve superior organizational performance?  Borrowing from a November 1993, American Bookseller article, I note that outstanding leaders share three characteristics:  vision, values and courage.
<P>
First, successful leaders have "the ability to see the present as  it is and to define a better future."  This vision must make sense and inspire "strong, simultaneous feeling of hope and pride in its accomplishment."
<P>
Key values most identified with leaders are a focus on serving others, a belief in continuos improvement and support for the empowerment of those they lead.
<P>
Finally, leaders have the courage to act.  It is action that "separates mere thinkers from leaders and the courageous from the timid."
<P>
The J.A. and Kathryn Alberston family as given Idaho educators and opportunity of historic proportions.  Now it's up to us to find within ourselves new visions, strong values and the courage to act.  We must find, grow and become Idaho education's leaders.<BR>
<I>J.Solberg, Director</I>

<i>Remember to Pack Your Maintenance Manual</i>
<hr size="2" color="#2A7FAA">

Almost twenty-five years ago a new textbook on quality appeared on bookstore shelves, magazine racks, grocery store counters, and gas station restroom sinks.  Well, this book wasn't quite that ubiquitous ... and perhaps wasn't in the traditional sense a textbook; however, it was about quality.  Yes, you guessed it Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was that now classic book which rapidly became a 70s' Bantam bestseller.
<P>
Now if you'd like to solve a few mysteries of quality, or Quality, turn to these pages of the 1981 edition:
<P>
<IMG SRC="zen.gif" WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="140" ALIGN="Left" BORDER="0" HSPACE="6">
p. 163 - 164 on What is quality?<BR>
p. 254 - 255 on Where should I look for Quality?<BR>

p. 264 - 266 on How can our minds work on quality?<BR>
