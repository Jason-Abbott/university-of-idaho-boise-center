	<b>Unique Application Process Launches Quality Leadership Institute</b></font></td>
<tr>
	<td bgcolor="#FFFFAA"><font size=2>

Twenty-five members of the Idaho Quality Leadership Institute (QLI) will soon begin a yearlong learning experience designed to help them expand their roles as agents of positive change in education. Institute members include public school teachers, principals, superintendents, and five staff and faculty members of Idaho¹s colleges and universities. All completed a unique application process that included self-assessment and assessment by several colleagues. "We were looking for individuals who believe - and whose colleagues believe - that they exhibit characteristics identified by professional literature as those of developing leaders," stated QSC Project Consultant Lin Laughy. "We didn¹t care so much about degrees, resumes and other kinds of information provided in typical applications. We wanted to identify individuals who, among other things, are deeply motivated by cause, possess a passionate love of learning, are collaborative and synergistic, and believe that reality is malleable."
<p>
Institute members will participate in a series of special workshops and seminars during the coming year, along with biweekly audioconference sessions. The program will be based on the work of such scholars and writers as Joel Barker, Warren Bennis, Bill Cooke, Stephen Covey, Peter Drucker, John Gardner, Robert Greenleaf, Joseph Jaworksi, John Kotter, Tom Peters, Peter Senge, and Margaret Wheatley.
<p>
Julie Solberg, QSC Director, recently noted that QSC is dedicated to developing in-state capacity to effect continuous process improvement in education. "If we want different results, we must do things differently," observed Solberg, "and change requires leadership. Not by the single hero leader of the past, but rather by servant leader's who, in turn, stimulate the growth of additional leaders."
<p>
The QLI application was designed to be a meaningful learning experience for anyone interested in exploring the topic of leadership and relating the characteristics of leaders to one's own life. You can access the entire application on the QSC website under menu item <a href="../activities/activities.asp">Special Activities.</a>

In mid-September, Julie Solberg, Director of Idaho's Quality Schools Consortium, announced the selection of a team of four Trainer-Coaches (TCs) who will assist Consortium member school districts in implementing Quality Management practices. The Consortium had sought and found individuals with extensive knowledge of school systems, Quality Management, change and leadership and with strong backgrounds in training methods, group facilitation and consulting. Following a two-day TC meeting and the refinement of the QSC training model, the Trainer-Coaches have now presented awareness workshops to personnel in five school districts and have scheduled others.

	Reflections from the QSC Director</font></td>
</table>

The Quality Schools Consortium is dedicated to dramatically improving the quality of student learning. "So help teachers apply Quality in the classroom," one might argue, "because that's where student learning occurs." That is a place to begin...as it was at <a href="http://www.nwrel.org/scpd/sirs/9/s035.html">Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka, Alaska</a>, where, in the late '80s, <a href="http://www.wtp.net/langford/">David Langford</a> began applying Quality principles and practices in his classroom. Other faculty members and the administrators witnessed the results. Soon the entire school forged into Quality pioneering, with wonderful results for Edgecumbe's students.
<p>
My first classroom-level experience with Quality came to a different end. Having read about Quality and become intrigued by its theories and concepts, I had prepared a successful grant application to support innovative Quality efforts in one school with an enthusiastic team of second and fourth grade teachers. After launching what we considered a solid process, expansion of our efforts was halted by an administrator who did not support Quality.
<p>
I tell of these two cases to illustrate that the question for QSC is not whether to focus staff development activities at the classroom level or at the school or district level, but rather how to emphasize systems thinking and help everyone recognize the interdependence of all parts of the system. Thus, we begin QSC on-site training with an emphasis on general awareness for all concerned through a phase we call "plowing the ground." We know that the implementation of Quality requires constancy of purpose and everyone involved in the pursuit of that purpose. We believe that we need to curve the lines that often define dichotomous thinking - i.e., a focusing on two opposite alternatives - until the ends of the lines draw closer and closer and finally meet. Then we'll have a circle, with the system's purpose in the center - all faces seen and all voices heard 'round the table. Soon, synchronicity and synergy will define our modes of functioning as we proceed to create our own futures and, in turn, to truly impact children.<br><i>

	<b>Steering Committee Reviews QSC Progress</b></font></td>

	<td bgcolor="#FFFFAA"><font size=2>

The QSC Steering Committee met on October 13th to review progress on the 1998-'99 QSC goals and conduct other committee business. Members in attendance were Jim Peterson, Sue Scott, Gary Delka, Will Spalding, Roland Smith and Sally Anderson.
<p>
QSC Director Julie Solberg outlined the training model refined by the Trainer-Coaches (TCs) at their September meeting. This model was based on the QSC <a href="../papers/qscte.asp">working paper on training</a> and reflects the recommendations of the research literature, of the educators that participated in QSC training last year, and on the more than one hundred years of combined educational experience of the TC team. The Steering Committee recommended that the plan be implemented as presented.
<p>
Solberg also delivered an update on the status of the Quality Leadership Institute, the FY98 and FY99 QSC budgets, and QSC school district membership. A brief on-line introduction to the alpha copy of QSC's new website proved a delight to Steering Committee members.
<p>
Members also engaged in a lively discussion regarding the business partner program included in QSC's FY99 goals and activities and made numerous recommendations regarding how such a program could be designed and implemented.
<p>
<b>The next Steering Committee meeting is scheduled for January 20, 1999, at the University of Idaho, Boise Center. Anyone wishing more information about the meeting may contact <a href="mailto:jsolberg@uidaho.edu">Director Solberg</a>.</b>

<font face="arial"><b>Resources For Traveling the Quality Road</b></font></center>
<hr size="2" color="#2A7FAA">

"Quality management is for industry, not schools." Have you heard this remark? Or perhaps had a similar thought yourself? A great way to examine issues underlying this remark and to further introduce yourself to Quality in education is to visit the <a href="http://deming.ccs.clemson.edu/pub/den/deming_tribus.htm">Deming Electronic Network website</a>.
<p>
This site includes all of Dr. Myron Tribus' essays on the topic of Quality. Tribus heads Exergy Corporation and has for many years served as a Quality Management consultant. He was previously a senior vice president with Xerox and director of the Center for Advanced Engineering Study at MIT. Tribus has over the years been one of the most convinced and most convincing advocates of applying Quality principles and practices to education.
<p>
Ten of his essays appear under the heading "Educational Quality". Of these, two provide a particularly rich introduction to Quality: Quality Management in Education and TQM in Education: The Theory and How to Put It to Work. While some repetition of ideas occurs between the two essays, their informative depth reinforces and expands acquired prior knowledge.

"This is the true joy in life...being used for
a purpose recognized by yourself as a

of a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments
and grievances complaining that the world

The essay Quality in Tasmania details how the staff at Riverside Primary School in Launceston, Tasmania, applied Quality in their school. The Application of Quality Management Principles in Education at Mt. Edgecumbe High School chronicles the introduction of Quality and the fine results achieved at a public boarding school in Sitka, Alaska.

In other words, for the price of a few mouse clicks and sheets of printer paper, you can access insightful Quality information and examples of Quality's application in education and get into the mind of one of Quality's pioneers.
