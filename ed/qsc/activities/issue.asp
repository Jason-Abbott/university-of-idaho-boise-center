Many issues in education indeed seem to be puzzlers, and many of us ponder them as we constantly strive to better serve our students. This section of Special Activities identifies such puzzlers and asks for your thoughts and ideas. Each puzzler will appear for approximately two weeks and comments will be posted during that time period. Past puzzlers will be archived for access by newcomers to the QSC website.

<a href="mailto:<%=webmaster%>">Send your thoughts, ideas and recommendations about specific puzzlers to the webmaster.</a> We would also enjoy your suggestions for future Puzzlers - those gnarly issues you would like to see discussed in this portion of Special Activities.

Most organizations find the creation of new systems a challenging task. Educational organizations are no exception. For many school administrators, change seems much easier to accomplish at the elementary school level (particularly the primary level) than it does at the high school. Do you think change is more difficult to accomplish at the high school level than at the elementary level?  If so, why do you think this is the case? What do you think might be the root cause? What could be some possible solutions to the problem?
