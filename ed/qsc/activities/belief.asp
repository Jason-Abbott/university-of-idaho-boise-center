Our beliefs provide a powerful influence on our behavior.  This exercise will help you examine your personal beliefs about teaching and learning and, if you wish, to compare those beliefs with the belief system underlying today’s reform  movement in education.
<P>
Below you will find two opposing descriptions of ten separate beliefs about learning and teaching.  You are asked  to select along this scale the number that corresponds to the position you now hold.  Please be as honest with yourself as you can be.
<P>

<B>A.</B>  Beliefs about intelligence guide many decisions in education, from the organization of special education to the placement of individuals in various courses of study.  The term as used here refers to an individual’s ability to learn, which may or may not be represented by the formal score on an IQ test.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Intelligence is singular, fixed and readily measurable.
<p>
10.  Intelligence is multiple, fluid and difficult to assess.</I>

<B>B.</B>  The distribution of learning abilities among students poses another dichotomy in education beliefs, generally centered around the concept of the normal curve.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Learning ability, and quite likely motivation and other student-related inputs to the education process, are distributed along a bell-shaped curve, in which approximately 15% - 20% of students are smart, approximately 15% - 20% are slow, and the vast majority are average.
<p>
10.  A normal curve describes a distribution of characteristics within a population that results when no intervention occurs.  Intervention strategies, such as instruction, can significantly alter such distributions.</I>

<B>C.</B>  Many educators make free use of rewards in the instructional setting- gold stars, personal recognition, grades (when positive), etc.  Others decry the use of such reinforcement, believing that it negatively impacts the learning process and decreased student’s long-term motivation to learn.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Rewards motivate students to learn.  They increase both the quantity and quality of student learning performance.
<p>
10.  Rewards for learning cause poorer learning performance than would occur without them and, in the long run, lead to significant declines in student learning.</I>

<B>D.</B>  The topic of expectation has long been of interest to educators and has gained renewed attention with the standards movement.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Many variables control student performance, chief among which are intelligence, social background, values, and individual motivation.
<p>
10.  Expectation experts a powerful influence on learning, greater than many of the so-called "fixed" variables such as socioeconomic class.  Teacher expectations often lead to self-fulfilling prophesies.</I>

<B>E.</B>  Debate continues on the topic of who controls the conditions of learner success and whether such factors are within or outside of the regular school setting.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Research studies have clearly demonstrated that student achievement results from the values and motivation a student learns in the home and community.  Drugs, dysfunctional families, single-parent homes, television- all make it difficult to impossible for educators to do their jobs.
<p>
10.  Schools control the conditions of learner success, which have much more to do with the curriculum, the quality of instruction, and performance expectations than factors external to the school setting.</I>

<font color="#2A7FAA">
<B>F.</B>  Equal opportunity has long been a major underlying theme of public education.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Schools provide equal opportunities for all students to learn.  Differential rates of learning result from student abilities, motivation, and other factors largely external to the instructional environment.
<p>
10.  Schools typically favor certain classes of pupils:  male over female; white over non-white; higher over lower socioeconomic class; verbal/analytical thinkers over other learning styles.  Student learning results reflect this unequal treatment as much more than factors external to the instructional environment.</I>

<B>G. </B> Two major definitions of teaching exist, even in the dictionary!</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Teaching is the act of presenting information to students and providing them the opportunity to learn.
<p>
10.  Teaching does not exist without learning taking place.</I>

<font color="#2A7FAA">
<B>H. </B> Beliefs differ on the value of competition and cooperation in the learning environment.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Competition exists in the real world and should be reflected in the learning environment.  Competition helps motivate students to learn.
<p>
10.  Competition motivates a small number of learners to pursue victory, which may or may not be connected to learning.  Cooperation provides the ideal setting for learning activity.</I>

<font color="#2A7FAA">
<B>I.</B>  Significant debate is occurring in the country on the topic of ALL students.</font>
<P>
<I>1.  Children vary greatly in their learning rates and abilities and will accomplish any given learning task at various levels of quality.  One of the tasks of any school is to help students become aware of their abilities and to develop realistic expectations and plans for the future.
<p>
10.  All children are capable learners, and all but the truly learning handicapped can master a demanding curriculum at a high standard given appropriate instruction and sufficient learning opportunity.</I>

<B>J.</B>  National standards; state standards; school standards; individual standards…</font>
<P>
<I>1.  The purpose of the education system is to produce students who meet a uniform set of standards at a high level of competence in a number of prescribed areas, e.g., science, mathematics, social studies.
<p>
10.  The purpose of the education system is to develop the unique talents and genius of each individual to the highest possible level.</I>
