<font face="arial"><b>IDAHO ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAMS</b></font>
<hr size="2" color="#ffcc00">
Adult Basic Education (ABE) Programs are offered in the six regional Post-Secondary Institutions in the State (BSU, CSI, ISU, EITC, LCSC, and NIC).  There is a Learning Center at each site and each site serves their geographical region.

<font face="arial"><b>PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITITES</b></font>
<hr size="2" color="#ffcc00">
The regional training opportunities of the Idaho Professional Development Series are designed for teachers, paraprofessionals, tutors, volunteers, and administrators committed to expanding and enhancing their current practices and knowledge.  The Professional Development series is based on modules developed by the National Institute for Literacy and the Northwest Regional Literacy Resource Center (NWRLC) addressing the key needs of Adult Basic Education (ABE) practitioners.  Theory, demonstration, practice, structured feedback, application, and reflection are integral components of each training opportunity.  Comprehensive learning strategies have been built into each workshop.  The workshops are designed employing the best practices in delivering staff development and training.  The modules are interactive in that they require reading, reflection, and application of key principles and methodologies.  The modules were developed for practitioners by practitioners to maximize relevance and transferability of material.  
<p>
This series of professional development workshops for basic skill providers and others allied with basic skills systems are revisions of work undertaken by Pelavin and Associates (with San Francisco State University as subcontractor).  Following initial development, the modules were later revised and a system for their implementation was developed by the Northwest Regional Literacy Resource Center (NWRLRC) through a grant with the National Institute for Literacy (NIFL).  Most modules include about 12-14 hours of training activities, intended to be delivered in two sessions within an interim period of several weeks for participants to complete assignments applying the principles of the first session.  The Idaho Dept. of Education/Office of Adult Education funds the partnership we enjoy with the Northwest Regional Literacy Resource Center and the University of Idaho.  This partnership allows us to share resources, planning, and development of staff development modules with Oregon, Alaska, Washington, and Wyoming.  While the PDS is a major part of our professional development process, it is not the whole.  The PDS is the "centerpiece" of our training, but it does not encompass everything we are doing in the area of professional development.
<p>
Support for the cost of the Professional Development Series (PDS) Training is provided by the Idaho State Department of Education/Adult Education office with Federal Adult Education Act 353 Funds through a project with the University of Idaho College of Education, Adult Counselor and Technology Education.
